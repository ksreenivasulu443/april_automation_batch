# Python fundamental data types:
#
# 1. *Integer:*
#    - What is the maximum and minimum value that can be represented by an integer in Python?
#    - Explain the difference between int() and float() conversion functions in Python.
#    - How do you convert a string containing a numerical value to an integer?
#    - Can you explain the concept of integer division and how it differs from regular division?
#    - How would you check if a given number is even or odd in Python?
#
# 2. *Float:*
#    - What is the difference between float and integer division in Python?
#    - How do you ensure precision when dealing with floating-point numbers in Python?
#    - Explain the significance of scientific notation in representing floating-point numbers.
#    - How would you compare two floating-point numbers for equality in Python?
#    - What are the potential issues with comparing floating-point numbers for equality?
#
# 3. *Boolean:*
#    - What are the possible boolean values in Python?
#    - How does Python interpret non-boolean values in a boolean context?
#    - Explain the difference between the and, or, and not logical operators in Python.
#    - How would you convert a non-boolean value to a boolean value in Python?
#    - Describe a scenario where short-circuit evaluation of boolean expressions is beneficial.
