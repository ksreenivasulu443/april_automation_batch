# In Python, identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or any other objects. Here are the rules for naming identifiers in Python
#
# Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_)
# Python identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, “Source_count” and “source_count” are different identifiers
# There is no specific length for variable name/class name/ function name/module
# Cannot be a Python keyword. Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python, like if, else, for, while, etc.
# It shouldn't start with number
# No spaces or special characters are allowed except underscores (_) within the identifier name.

# ---------EXAMPLES OF IDENTIFIERS------------
# count
# total_count
# firstName
# total_amount_3
# source_table_name
# 1_transformed_records
# Target count
